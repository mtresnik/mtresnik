## About Me

I’m a software engineer passionate about **algorithm design, geospatial systems, and full-stack development**. I enjoy turning complex problems into **elegant, practical solutions**, if such a thing exists.  

Three words to describe me are: curious, analytical, and adaptable. I love exploring new technologies and ways to improve software systems. Outside of coding, I enjoy **coffee, plants, jazz, and spending time with my two cats**.

**Databases:** MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch  
**Cloud & DevOps:** AWS (EC2, S3, SNS, Kinesis, ElastiCache)  
**Other Expertise:** GIS ([Geographic Information Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system)), Multi-Factor Authentication, Computer Vision ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision)), Algorithm Design ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm)), Simulation, Full-Stack Architecture

## Featured Projects

### Solving Minesweeper Algorithms
AI-driven [Minesweeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)) solver using logic, probability, and constraint evaluation.  
It can automatically determine safe moves, demonstrating problem-solving and logical reasoning. This is loosely based on the Harvard senior thesis [Algorithm Approaches to Playing Minesweeper](https://dash.harvard.edu/entities/publication/73120378-eb34-6bd4-e053-0100007fdf3b).

### Falling Particles Simulation
Real-time particle simulation with gravity, collisions, and interactions.  
This project demonstrates principles of [physics simulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_engine) in software.  
[GitHub](https://github.com/mtresnik/cpart) | [Video Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4Isk08SqPQ)

### Maze Generation & Solving + Dynamic Cost Function Solver
Adaptive algorithm solving optimization problems with changing cost functions.  
This is an example of [optimization algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization) applied to real-world decision-making.  
Generates and solves random mazes using pathfinding algorithms like [BFS/DFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal).  
This illustrates [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) and algorithmic thinking in a visual way.
